Django Registration System
This project demonstrates a simple user registration system implemented using Django, a high-level Python web framework. It provides functionality for users to sign up, log in, log out, and access a home page after authentication.

Features
User Signup: Users can register by providing a unique username, email, and password. Passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials (username and password).

User Logout: Users can log out of their accounts securely.

Home Page: After successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page where they can perform various actions depending on the application's requirements.
